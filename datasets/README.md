# Datasets - About

### Brief Preface

Originally, the project was 100% going to be centered around live data. That
being said, it would take some time of running in the background to yield
anything particularly interesting. So, this dataset is included.

## ETHUSD_Bitfinex_M_historical.csv

This dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/termoniab/cryptocurrency-ethereum-1m-price?select=ETHUSD_Bitfinex_M_historical.csv).
In it are minute-by-minute ETH to USD prices from Nov 15, 2020 to Feb 18, 2021.
