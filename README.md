# COGS 182 Final Project

### Overview

1. The state, actions, and environment were implemented in `environment.py`, algorithms in `algorithms.py`, and cryptocurrency-transaction related methods in `cryptocurrency.py`.
2. datasets used for runs are stored in the `./datasets` directory. Note that a README file is included there, with sources used for the datasets.

`final_project.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook used to explore the outcomes of algorithms with different parameters.

### Python environment details

The environment used is [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), as that's the only Conda distribution that has native support for Apple Silicon Macs at the moment. That being said, any Conda distribution (i.e. Anaconda) should be fine.

In addition, I used [TQDM](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) to visualize progress for longer computations.

The python version used is Python 3.9.1
